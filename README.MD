## SANASTORM

This extension displays cases, conjugations and translations of selected finnish words.

After cloning, run ```npm install``` to download dependencies.

When developing, we use "Webpack Extension Reloader" to automatically to bundle and load the extension.

use ```npm run``` to run webpack on watch mode which will update the extension on every change.

to build, use ```npm run zip``` - this will call webpack to bundle the files and then zip them into sanastorm.zip
